Uses PySpark to demonstrate, analyse and test the scalability of data pipeline that includes feature extraction, filtering and cleaning, for downstream ML purposes such as seq2seq models and sentiment analysis models

Instructions to run the project:
- download LocalSparkSession.ipynb
- download the dataset from https://zenodo.org/records/1043504#.Wzt7PbhXryo
- extract the dataset to same folder as the notebook
- create a buffer/output JSON file and store it in the same folder as the dataset and notebook. Suggestively name it "corpus-chunk.json"
- refer to python notebook or report for further clarification
